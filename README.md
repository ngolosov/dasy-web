DasyWeb is an open-source web application that simplifies the process of creating dasymetric maps. It aims to provide an easy-to-use, publicly accessible tool for a wide audience, enabling users to estimate urban population density using building parameters as a proxy value. DasyWeb assigns population counts to individual buildings, creating fine-scale population estimates that can be used for various purposes.

## Features

- User-friendly web-based interface
- Open-source, free to use and modify
- Eliminates the need for commercial or desktop GIS software
- Accessible to novice users without prior experience in GIS
- Provides fine-scale estimation of urban population density

## Getting Started

To use DasyWeb, simply access the web application through your preferred web browser. No installation or configuration is required.

## How to Use

1. **Upload data**: Upload your building and population data files in the shapefile format.
2. **Configure parameters**: Set the building parameters to be used as a proxy value for estimating population density (e.g., building area, height, floor count).
3. **Generate map**: Click on the "Generate Map" button to create your dasymetric map. The application will automatically distribute population counts to individual buildings based on the configured parameters.
